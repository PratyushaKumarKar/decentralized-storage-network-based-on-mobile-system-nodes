# decentralized-storage-network-based-on-mobile-system-nodes
So the vision of this project is to make mobile computers like laptops / mobile phones to be able to share their storage to the network and vice versa. 
target is to make a hybrid system which consists of a lot of mobile phones , laptops , PCs and workstations altogether. 
The miners can choose to provide processing power or provide storage or both for certain number of tokens in the network.
The end user can choose to either be a miner themselves ( mobile phones only providing storage space assigned by the user strictly and a very small fraction of their processing power with consent
or they can decide to be the user and buy storage on the network. they can either opt for a subscription model offered by the miners or they can pay for the amount of storage they are using.
this app aims to have a bigger userbase in the mobile phones userbase.
